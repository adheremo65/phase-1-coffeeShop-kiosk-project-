# keffa CoffeeShop Kiosk

 #              # Introduction
    This project is intended to server as kiosk for a mini coffeeshop.
     it should able to display the avialable coffee types and their associated detials.
#             This is how I come up with the project idea.

This project is inspired by the love i have for coffee growing up. And this is the prefect opportunity to make a website for my friends coffeeshop called keffaa. #what you need to run the app 1. clone the repository to your space. 2. The db.json will be used as an api for this project. 2. run the db.json server; you can use json-server --watch db.json on your space or terminal
 #              About the app
The front page of the app includes six type of coffee to select from.
The application will include the logo for the coffee shop followed by order forms.
The coffee image or card includes the flavor and the type of coffee.
The image cards will be clickable.
when the image got clicked, it should provide more information about the specific coffee.

#              This is how it works
        To use the app or order a coffee:
        1. There is a form at the top. you put your prefered name, select coffee type, size and quantity
        2. submit your selection
        3. when you submit, the app should display your selection and partial total cost
        4. if you decide to order, click the checkout button



# finally, I would like to mention that all the coffee images are taken from the popular Mkdonalds menu for coffee.
