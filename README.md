                 # Introduction
        This project is intended to serve as kiosk for a mini coffeeshop.
        This project is inspired by the love i have for coffee growing up. And this is the prefect opportunity to make a website for my friends coffeeshop called keffaa 
               
                #prerequsite 
        To run this project you need to run the json server as json-server --watch db.json and clone the repository into your space. 
               
                #This is how it works
        The app  should be able to display the avialable six type of coffees to select from and their flavors . 
        The application will include the logo for the coffee shop followed by order forms. The coffee image or card includes the flavor and the type of coffee. The image cards will be clickable. when the image got clicked, it should provide more information about the specific coffee selected. The db.json will be used as an api for this project.
