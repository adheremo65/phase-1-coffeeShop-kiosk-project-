# phase-1-coffeeShop-kiosk-project-
its is a kiosk to order coffee in keffa mini shop 
This project is inspired by the  love i have for coffee growing up. And this is the prefect opportunity to make a website for my friends coffeeshop called keffaa. 
This web is basically used to order coffee in keffa coffeeshop. 
The application will include the logo for the coffee shop followed by order forms. 
The order form will be submited once the customer selects theier order.
when the order got submited, order information like the prfered name will be displayed for the user and the employee
The customer should able to see their selection and totoal price before final check out. 
The front page of the app includes six type of coffee to select from including size and price
The coffee image or card includes the flavor and the type of coffee. The image cards will be clickable. 
when the image got clicked, it should provide more information about the specific coffee.
The db.json will be used as an api for this project.
